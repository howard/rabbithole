The Rabbit Hole
===============

This is a replacement for the default web interface of the [PirateBox](http://piratebox.cc).

To "install" it, simply download the [ZIP](https://github.com/howard/rabbithole/archive/master.zip)
and extract it within /opt/piratebox, assuming you are running the OpenWRT variant of PirateBox.
